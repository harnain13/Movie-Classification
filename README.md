# Movie-Genre-and-Revenue-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

#This project has been completed as apart of the team project to build a ML model for predicting the genre and revenue range of the movies dataset. 

#The data was taken from kaggle that includes the list of the top 10,000 most popular movies on IMDb. The dataset includes information such as movie title, release year, runtime, genre, and other relevant features. 

#The goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis based on various features. We wanted to develop accurate and reliable models that can help in predicting the genre and revenue range of movies, which can be useful in applications like movie recommendation system.

#In conclusion, we found that ML models can be trained to predict movie genre and revenue range with reasonable accuracy using features such as popularity, vote_average, vote_count, and runtime. This project provided us insights into the importance of features to predict the movie genre and revenue range and portraits the potential of ML in movie analytics.
